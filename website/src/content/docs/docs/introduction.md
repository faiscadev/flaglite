FlagLite is an open-source feature flag service that lets you ship features safely without the enterprise complexity.

## What is FlagLite?

FlagLite gives you:

- **Boolean flags** — Turn features on/off instantly
- **Percentage rollouts** — Ship to 5% of users, then 50%, then everyone
- **Multi-environment** — dev, staging, prod, all separate
- **API-first** — If the dashboard can do it, so can curl
